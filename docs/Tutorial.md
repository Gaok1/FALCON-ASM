# FALCON-ASM Tutorial

Welcome to the FALCON-ASM platform tutorial — an introductory guide to the main features and workflow of the tool.


## 1. Introduction

FALCON-ASM combines an IDE and a simulator to make learning the RISC‑V architecture easier. You can write, assemble, and run assembly code while observing in real time the behavior of memory, registers, and the decoding of each instruction.


## 2. Interface Structure

The interface is organized into tabs that mirror the development flow:

1. Editor — write and assemble code
2. Run (Simulation) — step execution; view memory and registers

---

## 3. Tab: Text Editor

The Editor tab is the starting point. Here you can write, assemble, import, and export RISC‑V assembly code.

### Key Features

- Build Status: shown in the Editor Status section (image [1]), indicating the result of assembly.
- Import and Export:
  - Text files: `.asm` and `.fas`
  - Binaries: generated by Falcon (`.bin`)
- Build Shortcut: `Ctrl + R` assembles the code and shows the status.

### Code Structure

You may write instructions directly without declaring sections. When you need data, use:

```asm
.section .data   ; or just .data
```

to delimit the data region, and:

```asm
.section .text   ; or just .text
```

to delimit the instruction region.

## 4. Tab: Run (Simulation)

The Run tab is dedicated to execution and detailed inspection of the program. You can track memory, registers, and the binary decoding of instructions.

Each executed instruction presents:

- Field Map: a binary map of each instruction field
- Parsed Fields: decoded field values
- Console: allows I/O interaction

### Resizing Windows

You can freely resize windows in this tab. Move the cursor to a window border (indicated by an arrow). If it turns yellow, resizing is available. Click, hold, and drag:

- Console: vertical (up/down)
- Instruction Memory: horizontal (left/right)

### Run Controls

Control execution and how memory is decoded using toggles:

- State: switch between RUN and PAUSE
- View: switch between Registers and RAM

### Memory Window

The left window in Run shows memory and registers; both can be scrolled with the mouse wheel. Switch the view with the View button in Run Controls.

Data interpretation modes:

- Hex: hexadecimal
- Dec: decimal
- STR: ASCII text

#### Decimal Options

In Dec mode you can toggle between:

- SGN: signed numbers
- UNS: unsigned numbers

#### View RAM

In RAM view you can jump to areas of interest such as:

- .data: where `.data` values reside
- Stack: the stack region pointed to by SP (stack pointer)

You can also change address grouping to 4B, 2B, or 1B.

### Instruction Memory

This window shows the progress of the PC (Program Counter). The yellow band marks the instruction currently at PC. Instruction Details, Field Map, and Parsed Fields reflect it in real time.

#### Instruction Hover

When you hover an instruction, a blue bar appears next to it. Clicking moves the PC to that instruction. The hovered instruction defines what is shown in Instruction Details, Field Map, and Parsed Fields.

#### Manual Step

To inspect programs in detail, you can advance the PC manually. With the simulation paused, press S to step to the next instruction.

## 5. Performing I/O

FALCON-ASM aims to be straightforward while remaining faithful to RISC‑V behavior. To reduce boilerplate and keep code readable, it provides pseudo‑instructions for common tasks — especially I/O and stack handling.

While all pseudos are documented in `format.md`, this chapter shows a practical example demonstrating I/O interaction and how these abstractions help development.

The code below uses I/O pseudos (`printStr`, `readWord`, `print`, etc.) to read two numbers, add them, and print a formatted result.

```
.data 
 start: .asciz "Enter two numbers"
 theSum: .asciz "The sum of "
 with: .asciz " with "
 is: .asciz " is "
 void: .asciz ""
number1: .word 0
number2: .word 0

.text 
printStrLn start
readWord number1
readWord number2
printStrLn void
call calculate

printStr theSum
print s1
printStr with
print s2
printStr is
print s0

halt


calculate:
    la t0, number1
    lw t1,0(t0)
    la t2,number2
    lw t3,0(t2)
    add s0,t1,t3
    mv s1,t1
    mv s2,t3
    ret

```
